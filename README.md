DevnologyDojo
=============

My attempts at using Python for the coding dojo startup challenge

In the end my score wasn't all that great (I didn't end up last though :sweat_smile:) â€” most of the time went
into getting the HTTP listener to work properly. I spent quite some time figuring out how to send the response body,
I would rather have liked to invest that time into adding more business logic.
